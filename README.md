# HelloWorld_Animated

The objective of this school project for AWA1 is to incorporate animations into a web project. 
The "HelloWorld_Animated" lists various programming languages, provides an overview of their basic concepts, and includes links for further learning.

## Versions
```bash
npm 8.3.1
framer-motion 7.6.18
react-syntax-highlighter 15.5.0
```

## Installation

Clone the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nomeos/HelloWorld_Animated.git
```

After that, you can install all the necessary dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

## Dependencies

The project utilizes **Framer-motion** as the primary animation library, with all animations designed to be compatible with it. 
Additionally, **React-syntax-highlighter** is used to make the code more readable and highlighted.

## External Component
### [Sidebar](https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-side-menu-mx2rw?from-embed)
The sidebar component was sourced from an external source and was modified to fit the project's needs by adjusting the color, content, icon, and links.

## Branching

For version control, I used the Gitflow branching model for its simplicity and ease of use. 
The specifications for this model can be found in the provided Wiki link: https://github.com/CPNV-ES-BI/BI_JAVA_GCP/wiki#branching.
